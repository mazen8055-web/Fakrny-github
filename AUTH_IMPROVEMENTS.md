# Authentication Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

Both login and signup screens now have comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback.

#### Login Screen
- **Email validation**: Checks for valid email format
- **Required field validation**: Shows which fields are missing
- **Inline error messages**: Displays errors directly below input fields
- **Visual feedback**: Red borders on fields with errors
- **Specific error messages**:
  - Invalid credentials
  - Email not verified
  - Empty fields
  - Invalid email format

#### Signup Screen
- **Full name validation**: Minimum 2 characters required
- **Email validation**: Valid format check
- **Password validation**: Minimum 6 characters
- **Password matching**: Confirms passwords match
- **Duplicate email detection**: Checks if email already registered
- **Inline error messages**: Shows errors below each field
- **Visual feedback**: Red borders on invalid fields

### 2. Real-time Feedback

- Errors clear automatically when user starts typing in a field
- Input fields are disabled while processing to prevent duplicate submissions
- Loading states show "Logging in..." or "Creating Account..." text

### 3. Error Message Examples

**Login Errors:**
- "Email is required"
- "Please enter a valid email address"
- "Password is required"
- "Invalid email or password. Please try again."

**Signup Errors:**
- "Full name is required"
- "Name must be at least 2 characters"
- "Please enter a valid email address"
- "Password must be at least 6 characters"
- "Passwords do not match"
- "This email is already registered. Please login instead."

### 4. Visual Design

- Error messages displayed in white text above input fields
- Invalid fields highlighted with red border
- General errors shown in a card at the top with red accent
- Clean, consistent styling throughout

### 5. Navigation Fix

- Proper navigation to home screen after successful login
- Proper navigation to home screen after successful signup
- Smooth transition with 500ms delay for better UX
- Error handling wraps auth calls in try-catch blocks
