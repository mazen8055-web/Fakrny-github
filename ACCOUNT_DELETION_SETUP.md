## üöÄ How to Provide URL to Google Play

Choose one of these methods:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
```bash
git add account-deletion.html
git commit -m "Add account deletion page"
git push
```
Your URL will be:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/fakrny/account-deletion.html
```

#### Option B: Netlify Drop (30 Seconds)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag `account-deletion.html`
3. Get URL: `https://random-123.netlify.app/account-deletion.html`

#### Option C: Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```
URL: `https://fakrny.vercel.app/account-deletion.html`

### Step 2: Add URL to Google Play Console

1. **Go to Google Play Console**
2. **Select your app** (Fakrny)
3. **Navigate to:** Store presence ‚Üí Store listing
4. **Scroll to:** Privacy Policy section
5. **Add URL in "Data deletion instructions":**
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/account-deletion.html
   ```
6. **Click Save**

---

## üìã Google Play Requirements

Google Play requires apps that collect user data to provide:

1. ‚úÖ **Privacy Policy URL** - Already created (`privacy-policy.html`)
2. ‚úÖ **Account Deletion URL** - Just created (`account-deletion.html`)

Both must be publicly accessible URLs.

---

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **User taps "Delete Account"** in Profile
2. **Confirmation dialog appears** with strong warning
3. **User confirms** by tapping "Delete Forever"
4. **App calls edge function** with user's auth token
5. **Edge function verifies user** using JWT
6. **Supabase deletes user** using admin API
7. **Cascade deletion** removes all related data:
   - Profile
   - Prescriptions
   - Medicines
   - Reminders
   - Logs
   - Chat history
8. **User is signed out** and redirected to login

### Database Cascade Deletion

All tables have `ON DELETE CASCADE` on foreign keys, so when the user is deleted:

```sql
profiles (id) ‚Üí CASCADE DELETE ‚Üí
  ‚îú‚îÄ prescriptions
  ‚îú‚îÄ user_medicines
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ reminders
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ medicine_logs
  ‚îî‚îÄ chat_history
```

Everything is automatically cleaned up!
